# Using Machine Learning to Eliminate Meetings

???

Welcome everyone.

# What are we going to do for the next 45 minutes?

???

I have been interested in machine learning for years, but could never think of a practical application

I'm going to share my recent inspiration and practical application examples with you today

# These include...

* hexapawn (and an analog neural network)
* A pure JS example of a simple neural network
* A (joke) idea to try to classify our lunch menu into "entrees" and "not entrees"

And finally...

## A neural network that put high level estimates on development stories

That is a good question.

# **Both personally and professionally:** I love tinkering with new technologies and solving problems with computers

Be it producing music

Or writing one of many "joke" web applications, including a rank order voting system that I used to pick the title of this talk.

My number one choice was "Scrum Masters Don't want you to Learn this One Weird Machine Learning Trick"

And my second choice was "You won't believe what happens when we send a machine to our sprint refinements"

I apparently am a fan of click bait titles

# Notes

* Talk about other factors that could contribute to predicting complexity (author, date, etc)
* "The best model might not be the one that is right the most, it is the one that gives you the answer you are looking for"
